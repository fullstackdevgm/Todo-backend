<h1>Beta Info</h1>
<br/>
<p>Welcome to Todo Cloud. </p>

<p>This is a BETA program and there will most certainly be issues that come up during use. We have worked out majority of the larger issues and it is your job to find the little tiny ones that we haven’t been able to find. </p>

<p>Our goal with this BETA test is to not only get Todo Cloud to work seamlessly with your iOS app but also to assist you with your planning and project management as an individual and as a team.  </p>

<p>Feedback is essential for this BETA test. We need to know what you like, what you don’t like, what works and what doesn’t. Please be honest in your feedback, don’t worry, we have a pretty tough shell and wont cry too much if you tell us the things you don’t like. </p>

<p>Finally, if you have any questions at all regarding the BETA test, please feel free to email Nick at nick@appigo.com. He is usually pretty quick to respond to emails so don’t hesitate to contact him. </p>

<p>Thank you again for participating in our BETA program, and don’t forget, it is a BETA, so keep it on the hush hush and have fun! </p>
