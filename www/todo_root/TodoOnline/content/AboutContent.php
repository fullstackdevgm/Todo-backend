<p>Welcome to Todo Cloud. </p>
<p>Todo Cloud is a web based platform that allows you to create lists that you can keep private or you can share with others to tackle projects together. Team managers are able to assign tasks to their team members who will receive notifications of tasks assigned to them. </p>
<p>Todo Cloud is designed with you in mind. We have included automatic task updates so when you change a task or project on your phone it is automatically updated online (requires refresh) and vice versa. </p>
<p>Todo Cloud was handcrafted by Appigo, Inc. Appigo, Inc. was founded in 2008 by two developers with a strong desire to build software that people could fall in love with and depend upon. Headquartered in Orem, Utah, the Appigo Team prides themselves for building easy-to-use apps for a variety of platforms including iPhone, iPad, Mac OS X, and Windows.</p>
<p>Appigo released two iPhone apps on July 11, 2008, the grand opening of the iTunes App Store for iPhone; Todo (powerful task management) and AccuFuel (fuel efficiency tracker). The company has a strong base of productivity-based apps which now include Notebook (notes available everywhere) and Corkulous for iPad (ideas at your fingertips).</p>
